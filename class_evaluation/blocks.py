'''
Being the chief civil Engineer of a civil construction companies
youre given a contract to construct a Python structure which is known for having 4rooms and toilet
 with the customer specifying the dimensions of the rooms of the house,
   find the total number of blocks, and total cost of the building a python 
   structure with a constant room height of 12ft using #600 blocks with a dimesion of 6" by 9" by 15" or 
   #1000 blocks with dimesion of 10" by 12" 20".
   create an algorithm to solve the problem
   write a python to solve the problem
