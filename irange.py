        Outer loop (for i i
        
        n range(1, 11)): This loop runs from 1 to 10, iterating through each number i.
        Inner loop (for j in range(1, i + 1)): For each i, this loop runs from 1 to i, printing the number i i times on the same line.
        print(i, end=""): This prints the number i without moving to a new line.
        print(): This moves to the next line after the inner loop has completed for the current i.
